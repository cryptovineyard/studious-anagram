                  <h2>What is Vineyard?</h2>
                  <p>We are an innovative take on most token miners. The contract acts as a MATIC reward pool, returning 8%* of your MATIC deposited on a daily 24-hour period. With most pool&#x27;s there&#x27;s a &quot;developer&quot; fee which taxes your deposits/withdrawals, usually this is sent to the owner-<strong>Thats where we are different</strong> compared to most reward pools- our deposit/withdrawal tax goes into an insurance fund for the contract. This is to ensure that if the project ever slows down, we can reward the last investors in the game, and to replenish the contract funds if needed. </p>
                  <p>The Vineyard is a locked staking rewards pool with a variable interest rate, the funds deposited are transferred into Winemakers and can not be un-staked, <strong>you can only withdraw your earnings.</strong></p>
                  <p><strong>How can we avoid what happened to other projects? </strong>Many other project's contract gave a fixed return, regardless of user activity, contract balance, etc. there was no variables in place that would allow the contract to adjust the returns if needed</p>
                  <p>Our contract allows the reward rate to automatically drop if the contract detects that users are <em>withdrawing too often </em>relative to the contract&#x27;s growth- It is based on the rehiring(fermenting) &amp; harvesting habits of the community. <em>To ensure the max rewards(8%)</em>, we recommend the strategy of <strong>Fermenting 6 Days/week, Harvesting 1 Day/week</strong> this reflects your own personal reward rate as well. Your personal habits hold much more weight regarding your overall rewards.</p>
                  <h4>More Tokenomics:</h4>
                  <p>•Rewards can be re-invested &amp; withdrawn daily.</p>
                  <p>•Max 300 Matic per Transaction</p>
                  <p>•To ensure the max rewards (8%) We recommend the following strategy:</p>
                  <p>•Fermenting(Re-hiring) 6 Days/Week and Harvest(Withdraw) 1 Day/Week•</p>
                  <p>•Every deposit/withdrawal is has a base tax of 8% to ensure contract longevity, along with an insurance fee (listed below)</p>
                  <p><strong>Insurance:</strong></p>
                  <p>•Of the 16% tax, 8% is dedicated to the Insurance treasury, which is used for contract replenishment &amp; buybacks).</p>
                  <p>•80% of the insurance treasury is dedicated to rewarding users who deposited most recently if the project ever slows down drastically.    </p>
                  <p>•20% is allocated for contract replenishments when the APR is low (if most users are withdrawing too often)</p>
                  <p>All of these methods are in place to best ensure the reward rate for everyone.</p>
